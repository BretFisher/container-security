# Docker and Kubernetes image and container security *better* practices

A talk on tools and processes that will improve your security posture. Meant for mere mortals. Achievable by those doing *solo DevOps*.

First given at [Civo Navigate 2023](https://www.civo.com/navigate) with the title "Real-world container & image security: Present and future."

## History of my rants about securing your containers (and code)

* Starting in 2018, I made my "top 10" security recommendations for people starting in Docker/Kubernetes (https://github.com/BretFisher/ama/discussions/150). It's had multiple updates over the years.
* [My DockerCon 2022 talk](https://github.com/bretfisher/nodejs-rocks-in-docker) mainly was a rant about default base images for languages. I picked Node.js. I tried to be nice.
* This repo tries to sum up this topic in 2023 for the "average" DevOps engineer, where a lot's happening in this space.
